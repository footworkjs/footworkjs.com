      <p>
        footwork.js is a front-end javascript framework based on several open source libraries, most notably including
        <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">knockout.js</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/postaljs/postal.js" target="_blank">postal.js</a>,
        <a href="http://lodash.com/" target="_blank">lodash</a>,
        and <a href="https://github.com/a2labs/riveter" target="_blank">riveter</a>.
      </p>

      <p>The primary goal of footwork is to provide a well organized, clean and powerful basis upon which web applications can be built, tested, and maintained.</p>

      <p>
        Feature-wise it can be thought of as competing in the same realm as
        <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>,
        <a href="http://emberjs.com/" target="_blank">EmberJS</a>,
        <a href="http://marionettejs.com/" target="_blank">Marionnette</a>,
        <a href="http://durandaljs.com/" target="_blank">Durandal</a>,
        and others. It is meant to provide a basis (the footing, if you will) of a web application, based
        on a combination of several well known open source libraries and design patterns.
      </p>

      <p>Footwork focuses on using pre-existing concepts, libraries, and APIs - while extending and adding in features where appropriate. This helps ease the learning curve as the
        terminology, concepts, and features are not completely foreign.</p>

      <p>With a few (very useful) novel features up its sleeve, a solid design, and consistent API you might just want to check footwork out!</p>
