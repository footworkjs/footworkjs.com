      <p>footwork.js is an open source project and was originally created by developer Jonathan Newman (<a target="_blank" href="http://staticty.pe">http://staticty.pe</a>).
      It was initially developed mostly over the latter half of 2014, however work on some of the core concepts and patterns used therein date back to as far as early/mid-2013.
      </p>
      <p>A lot of what has gone into footwork was built from experience and features garnered from other well known libraries and frameworks. Concepts and features such as 'outlets' (inspired from emberjs), routing (mostly inspired from Durandal), 
      and components (concept and code integrated from knockoutjs) were combined to create what has become footwork.</p>

      <p><em>footworkjs needs your support!</em></p>
      <p><em>Please consider contributing to the project if you find it at all interesting...pull requests are very welcome!</em></p>
