      <p>Footwork provides collections as an easy to use abstraction by which you can leverage the RESTful persistence and modeling features of a
        <span class="inline-code">dataModel</span> to create an easily managed list of them.</p>

      <p>Typically you will have a discrete <span class="inline-code">dataModel</span> which will represent an individual item in a
        <span class="inline-code">collection</span> which you might want to manage in your application. An example of this might be a list of contact
        numbers, or notes attached to a record.</p>

      <p>Knockout.js provides an <span class="inline-code">observableArray</span> type which is used to manage arbitrary lists of data while
        still enabling all of the awesome observable design pattern awesomeness that allows complex dependency chains and automatic resolution of
        computed values (and much more).</p>

      <p>Footwork builds upon the <span class="inline-code">observableArray</span> type to integrate the footwork-native
        <span class="inline-code">dataModel</span> and provide many handy features for managing lists of them.</p>

      <p>What does this mean exactly? It means that you can (in addition to the features notated below) treat a footwork
        <span class="inline-code">collection</span> just as if it was an <span class="inline-code">observableArray</span> (because it is). You can
        subscribe to updates to it, <span class="inline-code">push()</span>, <span class="inline-code">pop()</span>, <span class="inline-code">reverse()</span>,
          <span class="inline-code">sort()</span>, <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/observableArrays.html" target="_blank">and much more</a>.</p>
